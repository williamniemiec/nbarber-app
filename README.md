## ‚ùá Introduction
Takere for patients is a system that allows patients to have access to their care plans. They can see its progress along with elements that they have to complete. It is developed using React Native, which is a mobile development framework for generating mobile applications using component-oriented programming. It generates native applications for [Android](www.android.com) and [iOS](www.apple.com/ios) operating systems.

### ‚ö† Warning
The hosting service may have a certain delay (~ 2 min) for uploading the application so the loading of the website may have a certain delay. 

### Board
All care plan elements the patient should complete are grouped on the board. It is composed of a set of cards, where each card represents a care plan element, and it has two parts: the front and the back. The first is composed of four elements: the care plan element name, a title, its description, and an icon. Also, card color is defined by the care plan element color. The back contains care plan information (name and description), title of care plan element (Figure 1), the content of the care plan element (Figure 2), and a finish button.

### Agenda
The agenda aims to highlight care plan elements that should be finished as soon as possible. For that, we use two strategies: grouping these elements by deadline day and using colors (Figure 3). The first approach uses two groups: "today" and "tomorrow", and each of them contains care plan elements with the deadline for today or tomorrow, respectively. We have chosen to not include other groups because the agenda goal is to display urgent care plan elements that should be finished, and showing more than necessary can reduce its impact and cause unnecessary anxiety to patients. The second approach use colors to highlight elements closest to the deadline: red for today and yellow for tomorrow. This approach is based on studies showing that colors can engage people to do tasks.

### Progress
Progress screen shows patient progress in his/her care plans. For each care plan, it is shown a set of items containing progress information about each care plan element. This information includes the total of care plan elements of each type along with how many of them were completed, as shown in Figure 4.
